But being lazy has it's perks, it force us to find ways to make life easier for ourselves as well as others, David Dunham says that \"Efficiency is intelligent laziness\" and I couldn't agree more. So I began my studies in Higher Institute of Engineering in Porto (ISEP) in 2015 taking the course of Systems Engineering for three years. In 2018 I began my internship in Fundação Casa da Música as a Information Systems Technician where I worked with a great variety of tools, wich allowed my to learn new skills and most important, on how to comunicate with our clients (work colleagues). For that reason, I began to have interest in Searching/Designing and building solutions, in this case web applications that would make the work 'easier' through analysis of processes and finding points of improvement, sometimes the smallest change can cause the biggest impact.",
